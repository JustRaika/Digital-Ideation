# OOP (Objektorientierte Programmierung)
This folder contains all the assets from the OOP module. I have done many handwritten notes myself and coded along as well, starting with BlueJ and then moving on to Java in VSC. Also done quite a alot of self studying by doing old exams and completing a course on Sololearn.

For an online documentation of the course I can recommend Yanis's summary found [here](https://yanisdeplazes.github.io/Digital-Ideation/23HS/OOP/). He has a beautiful [cheat sheet](https://yanisdeplazes.github.io/Digital-Ideation/23HS/OOP/cheatsheet/), which I used as well during the exam.
