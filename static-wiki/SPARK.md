# SPARK (DI The History of Creative Sparks)
This folder contains all the assets from the SPARK module. 

The module was all about learning the basics of ideation and its conceptual environment. We learned about various ideation techniques and their applications in different fields. That included insights from the fields of cybernetics, information theory, computer basics, media theory, cybersemiotics, digital art. Possible digital futures were studied and critically considered.

For the final project, we held a presentation on different creative artists and thinkers of the past and present. We also created a tarot card set with 3 concepts for each thinker that was completed by other students fort a whole deck.
