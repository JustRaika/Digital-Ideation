# AD (Algorithmen & Datenstrukturen)
This folder contains all the assets from the AD module.
It's mainly my notes from the lectures, a final summary and a few snippets from hand-written code in Java.
I wrote `A LOT` of code by hand. The final exam was 4 hours code writting on paper, no aids allowed.

**Man, by now I dream in Java.**
