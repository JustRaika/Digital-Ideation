## Was ist Speculative Fiction?
“At the core of science fiction is the notion of extrapolation: of asking “if this goes on, where will it lead?” 

“That said, our job is not to predict the future. Rather, it’s to suggest all the possible futures — so that society can make informed decisions about where we want to go.”

## Was ist Science Fiction?
Science fiction is a genre of speculative fiction that typically deals with imaginative and futuristic concepts such as advanced science and technology, space exploration, time travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. It often explores the potential consequences of scientific innovations and societal changes, and can serve as a commentary on contemporary social, political, and ethical issues.
