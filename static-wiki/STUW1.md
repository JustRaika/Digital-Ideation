### Are we able to do data analysis of song lyrics using a large language model (LLM)?
 That was the question we dealt with in the Studio Web specialisation. The result is the well-rounded web application "Analyrics", which can be used to analyse the content of any song text via a fictional collective of critics. We realised this using the Spotify API and Gemini, among other things. And not only performance analyses were included, but also UX testing, which played a key role in shaping the UI.
