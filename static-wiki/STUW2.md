## General Project
* `What is it? -` A web event platform for Digital Ideation. This web application is designed to bring together Digital Ideation students across Emmenbrücke and Rotkreuz. The platform provides a space to coordinate, share, and discover upcoming events.

### Problem Statement
- Two campus locations create coordination challenges
- New students struggle with local transit info
- Transportation times vary significantly between users
- Eco-friendly options like biking are underused
- Staff often drive alone when transporting equipment
- Missed chances for social connections due to lack of visibility on who is traveling where
