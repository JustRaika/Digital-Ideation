# STUPR (Studio Physical Prototyping)
This folder contains all the assets from the STUPR module. The module is about physical computing and prototyping with microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, and other electronic components. It focuses on hands-on learning and experimentation, encouraging students to explore the possibilities of interactive design and physical computing.

*We are not looking at becoming engineers or electricians, but rather at building things  
using sensors and electricity with the purpose to create something interesting,  
intelligent or artistic. Remember that it’s much harder to use one single LED in a  
poetic way than building a rocket.*
